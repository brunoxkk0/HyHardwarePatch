# HyHardwarePatch
This early plugin provides a custom method for getting the UUID from the system, which is necessary in isolated contexts such as Docker containers.

### This plugin depends on the [Hyxin](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/hyxin) plugin.

### To install the plugin, create a directory in the root directory `earlyplugins` and put the .jar inside + when you launch the server, use this parameter `--accept-early-plugins`.
